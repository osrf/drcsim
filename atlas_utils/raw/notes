first, make sure that both atlas_utils and sandia_hand_utils are under ROS_PACKAGE_PATHS, then

run

bdi_parser atlas_utils/raw/drc_skeleton_vX.cfg to generate atlas.urdf

install generated atlas.urdf as atlas_utils/urdf/atlas.urdf

then

rosrun xacro xacro.py atlas.model.xacro > atlas.model
copy atlas.model into the gazebo model database as [somewhere]/model/atlas/model.sdf
