Gazebo is the basis for the DRC Simulator, which is used by participants in the DRC program, especially the Virtual Robotics Challenge (VRC), a cloud-based simulation competition scheduled for June 2013. Building upon Gazebo, the DRC Simulator, or DRCSim, comprises additional worlds, models, and code that is specifically required to simulate the DRC domain.
